# deadman-switch-failed

Sometimes, I get scared I won't leave anything. So I wanna leave this

Deadman Switch Failed is a project to enable the preservation of thoughts. What would have been letters on paper in the past can now be a digital delivery to your loved ones, individualized and personal

The basic idea is to have a vault where you can add letters, emails, and other for your friends, family, whoever. When something happens to you, the Vault can be unlocked, causing the decryption of your messages as well as Emails. It'll also send them after decrypting obviously

## Plans
- [ ] Add a website
- [ ] Make infrastructure to open a vault
- [ ] Send Emails on Vault Open
- [ ] Send SMS on Vault open (check cost first)
- [ ] Create Discord Bot
- [ ] Send messages to servers with Discord Bot (might actually be a dumb idea...)
- [ ] Do Discord integration? This might be a TOS violation
- [ ] Add a funny bunny
